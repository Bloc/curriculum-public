When you receive your first offer, you reel with excitement. You celebrate that moment and feel pride for everything you've accomplished. But keeping a cool head is just as important as going nuts with celebratory fist-pumps. All job offers come with pros and cons. This checkpoint will help you hang onto your limbs as you navigate the offer minefield.

## Evaluate the Offer

Each offer has variables that you must consider before accepting. These variables affect your wealth, career longevity, happiness, and other aspects of your life. As with any big decision, combine all factors to determine the value of each offer. Let's cover the critical factors and [calculate an offer's value](#offer-q-q).

<a name="variable-salary"></a>
### Salary

People usually prioritize salary when evaluating an offer, but we advise you to take everything into consideration. If the position requires relocation, consider how both local and state taxes will affect your take-home pay. And if the offer seems low, it's not always a reflection of you. Compare the offer to the average; research salaries on [JobStar](http://jobstar.org/tools/salary/index.php), [Salary.com](http://salary.com), the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/a-z-index.htm), and others.

Companies also compensate through other means: bonuses, stock options, and more. Factor all of these into the lifetime value of your employment. For example, if you expect to work there for at least one year, calculate your potential bonuses and granted shares and incorporate that into your take home.

<a name="variable-location"></a>
### Location

If you love where you live, then the quality of the offer must justify a relocation. Research the cost of living in or around the destination city. If you're willing to commute, look for housing in suburban areas and research the cost of living there as well. Most companies offer a relocation bonus, compare it to your expected rent and security deposit.

<a name="variable-benefits"></a>
### Benefits

A lower salary with a host of perks fares well against a high salary with no benefits. For example, 401k matching, health insurance, free food, commute compensation, open vacation policy, working from home, and more should factor into your decision. Factor any benefit that reduces your expenses into your take-home pay.

<a name="variable-path"></a>
### Career Path

If you like the company and imagine working there for several years, ask about growth potential. If they have a clear path to senior positions and salary increases, factor that into your decision. Some organizations are so small that moving up the ladder is tricky, but larger ones streamline this process.

<a name="variable-culture"></a>
### Culture

Your compatibility with the company's culture will play a huge role in your satisfaction. The best way to verify a good match is to speak with the people you will work with and ask them specific questions regarding their workplace. Ask how they feel about their managers, and if their managers welcome honest and open communication.

Ask about diversity and whether minorities hold leadership positions. A monoculture can lead to corporate environments unaware of their own bias. Also ask about company gatherings and how executives treat employees.

There's no limit to the questions you can ask, but keep them open-ended to give the employees an opportunity to go on tangents and offer anecdotes.

<a name="offer-q-q"></a>
### Calculate the Offer Quality Quotient

To quantify and compare the value of every opportunity, calculate the OQQ, or Offer Quality Quotient — something we made up. To calculate the OQQ, give each factor a score from 1 to 10, 10 being the best possible. Give each factor a level of importance: 0 being the least important, 10 being the most — these must add up to 10. For example:

| Factor | Score | Importance |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Salary | 8 | 6 |
| Location | 3 | 2 |
| Benefits | 6 | 0 |
| Career Path | 8 | 1 |
| Culture | 10 | 1 |

Multiply each factor's score with its importance, as a percentage, and add the results together. To calculate the OQQ of this offer, we do the following:

> (8 x .6) + (3 x .2) + (6 x 0) + (8 x .1) + (10 x .1) = **7.2**

By this math, you know that the highest possible score is 10. Use the OQQ to do quick comparisons when choosing between offers. Ultimately, if the numbers don't seem to line up with your gut, trust your instincts instead.

## Negotiate

In all cases besides internships, an element of negotiation can come into play. In this scenario and in most cases, the employer acts as the salesperson. They offer something of limited quantity, job opportunities, to a swathe of customers, applicants. Before entering any negotiation, prepare yourself for it.

<a name="prepare"></a>
### Prepare

Research the position you are applying for. Specifically, find the average starting salary for that role in your destination city. If the job is remote, look for the national average. This number gives you an idea of what's fair and the approximate maximum you should reach for.

If compensation is your primary concern, bring another offer with you to each negotiation; aim to receive multiple offers at once. With an offer in your back pocket, you walk in with concrete leverage that you can use during negotiations.

Speaking of negotiations, they can start in a number of ways. Let's look at some.

<a name="they-present-a-contract"></a>
### They Present a Contract

Some employers plop down a big stack of papers right in front of you as if to say, "this is the one and only deal we offer, take it or leave it." They may deliver this contract casually (in email) to brush past the fact that it dictates your salary and benefits. The contract may even have a cute title like, "Welcome to the Family!"

Ask to discuss the terms of the contract and follow the [steps below](#they-make-the-first-move). If that's their only offer, keep pressing to speak with someone. If they continue to deny you, consider the offer as-is and again, ask for a few days to think about it and contact Student Outcomes.

<a name="they-make-the-first-move"></a>
### They Make the First Move

The first move is the first figure, and if they present one then they've made the first move. In your excitement, you may err toward caution and accept this instantly: that is unnecessary. Evaluate this number and whether it reflects your experience and your needs. Statistically speaking, the final deal will resemble the first figure, but don't let that deter you.

If the number is insulting or just shy of what you expect, remain calm. The person that loses their cool also loses control of the negotiation. Let this first figure linger in the air and avoid saying anything. A moment spent here will feel like an eternity, but hold on tight. One of two things is likely to occur:

1. You break and present a counter-offer.
2. They break and ask you a question or present a new offer.

In the first case, the negotiator will likely rebuff you and stick with their initial offer. They gained the higher ground when you spoke first. And in the second case, if you hear an offer you're willing to accept, ask for a few days to think it over and contact Student Outcomes.

Otherwise, hold out again or present a counter-offer with the exact amount you want, e.g. $73,000, then wait patiently. If they refuse to acquiesce, proceed to [the next step](#they-dont-budge).

<a name="they-ask-for-a-figure"></a>
### They Ask You for a Figure

If you agree with statistics, the initial figure will resemble the final offer. When they give you this opportunity, aim slightly above your target, e.g. $70,000. Don't give them a ballpark figure or a range: they will focus toward the bottom of it. Once you've presented the number you want, buckle down and say nothing.

If the negotiator dismisses the number in any way, just sit there and remain calm. Don't say anything, don't flinch, don't laugh, merely live in that moment and wait for them to speak. Continue to hold out until they offer you a number you approve of. If they don't reach that number, move to [the next step](#they-dont-budge).

<a name="they-dont-budge"></a>
### They Don't Budge

If negotiations stall at a salary that you find less-than-satisfactory, try one of the following tactics.

- **Hold firm**<br>One option, and the simplest, is to do nothing. Thank them for their time and go home. Given the right circumstances, they may reconsider your offer overnight and continue negotiations the next day. Always send a follow-up email thanking them for their time and consideration.
- **Discuss benefits**<br>They can't offer you the salary you want, but what about benefits? They are not likely to come up with these, so you must surface them as possibilities. Ask about working from home, extra vacation, free food, commute reimbursements, and anything else that may sway you.
- **Reduce benefits**<br>If salary is critical, discuss a reduction or complete withdrawal of benefits to beef up the figure.
