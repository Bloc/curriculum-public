The standard process for most organizations includes an initial phone screen followed by an onsite interview. While most companies follow this path, others choose to diversify their hiring process with modern qualitative techniques.

## Pair Programming

This interview mimics your experience with your Bloc mentor: two programmers working together simultaneously. Interviewers can conduct this pair programming interview remotely or in person, and require you to share your screen with them. The interviewer will give you a project to complete within the hour; so don't expect an enormous task. For example, "build a Rails app to track teachers, students, and classes." Alternatively, they can ask you to clone an existing repository and add a feature to the source code.

The interviewer wants to see how you work and interact with your peers. This pair programming session will reveal your best qualities: disciplined workflow, your expressive communication, your Rails knowledge, and more. Here's a list of tips that will help you do your best during a pair programming interview:

- **Treat your interviewer like a teammate**<br>Consult with them on design choices, layout, anything and everything.
- **Refer to the book**<br>Use the Internet if you forget something but feel free to ask your interviewer first.
- **Take your time**<br>Completing the assignment on time is important but not nearly as much as showing off what you can do.
- **Be your own narrator**<br>Let the interviewer know what you're going to do before you do it, and take every opportunity to explain why.

## Take Home Assignments

Like pair programming interviews, the take home assignment measures how well you work. These assignments are more involved than pair programming sessions, so they will give you anywhere from one hour to two weeks to complete them. The assignments will resemble Bloc projects. They may provide assets, wireframes, and a full set of illustrated user stories to fulfill. For example, "build an online text editor that allows live collaboration between two users."

Due to the complexity of these assignments, you should drop everything you're doing to focus on them. Here are some tips to help you knock these take home assignments out of the park:

- **Do your research**<br>Unless you possess intimate knowledge of the project's tech requirements, don't rush to coding. Research existing solutions and limitations. If the assignment permits the use of any library, look into open-source tools as well.
- **Document everything**<br>Reading a *rushed* codebase with no comments is grueling work, don't make your interviewers do it. Document your classes and functions by standard practices. As you write your code, look at each line. If you feel the line requires a comment, add one.
- **Keep your code clean**<br>Stick to DRY principles (*don't repeat yourself*), avoid using global variables if possible, and use proper indentation and whitespace to keep your code legible.
- **Include a README**<br>As you did with your Bloc projects, include a README in the repository. This README should detail the project and give the reader an overview of its architecture.
- **Architect a real solution**<br>Due to the time constraint, you may feel that settling with a hacky solution is warranted: you're *wrong*. Interviewers want to see a solid codebase that they can extend immediately, not a product with heaps of [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).
- **Be original**<br>Copying code from a StackOverflow answer is fine, but if you fork a solution from GitHub and make modifications to suit your needs, that's hardly original work. Tools can check for plagiarism in source code and they will run them on your submission.
- **Be proud**<br>If they ask you open-ended questions about your work, discuss specifics that you're proud of. For example, a complex algorithm you created, a design pattern you chose, or a performance optimization you discovered along the way.

## Contract Work

Companies willing to take the time and spend a little bit of money will pay you for your interview. When compared to other interview types, this one provides the best sample of your work, communication skills, and aptitude. The organization will assign real work to you and pay you for it. Much like the take home assignment, you should dedicate all of your efforts towards this work.

Contract work interviews usually end with a follow-up interview where they review your work and ask you new questions. A lot of the same tips from take home assignments apply, but with some modifications:

- **Communicate a lot**<br>They will give you a point of contact within the team, communicate well and often with this person. Ask them questions and follow-up every day with progress updates.
- **Learn the codebase**<br>You won't learn everything there is to know, but prepare yourself to discuss the codebase from a bird's eye-view.
- **Follow the team's best practices**<br>If they have documents regarding their workflow, read them and adhere to them. If they have a consistent style to their source code, comments, or commit messages, mimic their style.
- **Get with the program**<br>This type of interview gives you a glimpse into the company's culture. If they're fun-loving gif blasters like the Bloc team, use gifs too. This helps the team feel like you're part of the company already.

## Personality Evaluation

This interview, otherwise known as [the beer test](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-decide-between-2-awesome-job-candidates), is an attempt to measure cultural fit. Interviewers want to know what kind of person you are and whether they would, "get a beer with you." You can substitute beer with any one-on-one social activity, but the gist of the question remains: would I hang out with this person?

Interviewers take this opportunity to ask you personal questions and get to know you. This is a difficult interview to prepare for, because any sign of preparedness can give off the wrong vibe. But you can use these tactics to bring out the best version of you:

- **Smile**<br>This one's simple, but people overlook it. Unless you're applying for Lead Complainer at Oscar the Grouch & Co., your interviewer wants to meet a happy person. We're not happy all the time, but a natural smile warms the room and puts your interviewer at ease.
- **Show confidence**<br>Keep strong eye contact, reduce the number of, "umms," in your sentences, apply matching pressure during handshakes, sit up straight, and in general, believe in yourself and what you're doing. Consider giving yourself a [pep talk beforehand](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en).
- **Be an open book**<br>Imagine the interviewer asks you, "what's your favorite memory?" You can answer this in one sentence with, "the time I won $8k in Vegas." Or, you can paint a vibrant story that captivates your interviewer's attention. You get no bonus points for speed, so treat this interview like a date and give them every reason to like you.
- **Reveal your passion**<br>When you speak with passion, people can tell; your words permeate the air and leave an impact on the listener. So when you get an opportunity to talk about something you have immense passion toward, take it. The interviewer wants to see a human with a beating, fiery heart.
- **Ask them questions, too**<br>As you answer these personal questions, you'll feel pretty good. That's because someone is making you the center of attention and they're actively listening to everything you say. Your interview loves that feeling, too. If you reciprocate and make them feel like the center of attention, they won't forget that.

## Assignment

> Begin this assignment after blocking off an entire day (24 hours) to work on it.

- Complete one of these Take-Home Assignments:
	1. Build a command line calculator that accepts text input, e.g. "1+4*3-4," and prints out the numeric answer. The calculator must support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers.
	2. Build a [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) multiplayer game. The game must print the board after each turn and support two local players.
	3. Write a [Slack plugin](https://api.slack.com/community) that tracks how much time each user spends on Slack. Let the user see their usage by typing a keyword, e.g. "/slacktrack."
- Mark the start time. After 24 hours elapses, stop working on the project regardless of what state it's in.
	- Submit the project to your mentor for review.
	- Discuss the project during your next meeting.

Use your imagination! We left the requirements purposely vague to test your creativity. And as you may have guessed, bonus features earn bonus points.
