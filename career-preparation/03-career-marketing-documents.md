Everyone looking for a job in the technology industry should have:

- a LinkedIn profile
- a résumé
- a polished GitHub profile

You should also create a portfolio site (see the Portfolio project, which is located in a separate section from Career Prep).

In this checkpoint, we'll show you how to build a great LinkedIn profile, leverage it for your résumé, and showcase your GitHub projects.

## LinkedIn

Why is LinkedIn so important?

- LinkedIn has hundreds of millions of users
- It's how most professional networking in the technology industry works
- It's a relatively low-effort way to get noticed.
- It's easy to search.
- It's easy to update.

Thinking and writing about your experience will be a lot of work. Don't try to do it all in one sitting.

### What should my LinkedIn profile accomplish?

Just as you would use Yelp, Rotten Tomatoes, or IMDB to review a restaurant, movie, or celebrity, so will potential employers use LinkedIn to review your professional accomplishments. When someone considers you professionally, they're likely to review your LinkedIn profile.

The #1 goal of your LinkedIn profile is to entice recruiters and hiring managers to contact you. To this end, it should only show your positive attributes.

### What *shouldn't* my LinkedIn profile accomplish?

Your profile's job is to encourage contact — not to get you the job. It should be simple, brief, and easy to skim. Every word should sell your ability. If you find a word that doesn't, delete it.

As a consequence of this brevity, your LinkedIn profile will not include every detail. See *Should I include caveats or qualifiers?* for some examples of what to leave out.

### Should I include caveats or qualifiers?

No. For example, imagine a team of ten engineers built a new product over three years, and you helped them for six months. You should still list accomplishments briefly, like:

> - Created a full-stack web application using Ruby on Rails & AngularJS
> - Scaled application to thousands of users using database sharding

Leave out caveats and qualifiers. Even if they make the statement more accurate, they complicate things and make your profile hard to read. So avoid:

> - Worked as part of a a team of 10 people during a 6-month internship to create a full-stack application using Rails 4 and Angular
> - Joined a small team of engineers focused on performance and implemented database sharding after the lead architect suggested it

You must be completely honest. That said, it is very easy to make your bullet points *too* accurate. If your bullet points are more than about 10 words, they probably have too much detail.

### What if the caveats/qualifications are important?

You can expand on them in an interview. Remember, the goal of your LinkedIn profile is to encourage contact with interviewers, not get you a job.

### How closely should my résumé mirror my LinkedIn profile?

It’s okay to have differences between the two, but they shouldn't be so different that they confuse hiring managers or employers.

### How can I find remote work on LinkedIn?

Your profile should show that you're an expert at remote work. Add recommendations for each of the remote experiences you have, and ask those writing these recommendations to highlight your ability to work remotely.

### Should I include informal work experience?

Definitely. Make sure *any* work experience is represented. Work experience is the most valuable thing you can add to your profile.

Include projects for family members, friends, and colleagues that required the skills you learned at Bloc. Also include freelance work.

### Should I include unrelated work experience?

Yes, but minimize detail. For example, if you worked as a dentist's office for 18 months, include that in your work history. Here's why:

- Employers want to know your general professional experience.
- You can demonstrate [transferable skills](http://www.ceswoodstock.org/job_search/resumeskillstransf.shtml) like project management, communication, data analysis, etc.
- Your experience in a specific [vertical market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalmarket.asp) (like dentistry) might be valuable to certain employers (like a medical billing software company).

That said, unrelated work is not the most important part of your profile, so only list 1–2 bullet points about these experiences.

### Should I tailor my profile to different jobs?

Craft your profile to fit the job you want most. Focus on that. Don’t adjust your profile for one-off positions.

### What about extracurriculars and languages?

Include extracurriculars and languages at the bottom and after all of the career-related sections.

Fun tidbits like being fluent in Arabic or Spanish, having 9 years of laser dentistry experience, or being involved in philanthropy makes you more human and paints a better picture of who you are.

### How should I order the sections?

LinkedIn lets you customize your profile by placing your sections in any order.

If, like most students, you're new to the field, use this order:

- Headline
- Summary
- Projects
- Experience
- Skills
- Education

If you have some directly related work experience, move "Experience" above "Projects":

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-job-prep/some-work-experience.jpg)</center>

### What should I include in each section?

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-job-prep/ideal-linkedin-profile.jpg)</center>

Here's a checklist for each section.

> Review [Hannah McExample's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-mcexample-43b249114) to see these tips in action.

#### Headline

- Include a professional-looking, well-lit photograph. It should be high resolution and you should be the only person in it.
- Change your subtitle to "Software Engineer," "UX Designer," or whichever fits the position you want.
- Remove Bloc from the "Education" line to keep employers focused on your experience. Show your most advanced degree here instead.
- Avoid job titles like "ninja," "rockstar," "wizard,"s etc.
- [Customize your LinkedIn URL](https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/87/~/customizing-your-public-profile-url), ideally to use your full name.

#### Summary

- Write two to four sentences summarizing your knowledge and experience.
- List areas of expertise.
- Include your desired position.
- Recruiters search this text, so include buzzwords like "JavaScript" and "Rails."
- Pictures say more than words. Add at least two screenshots of your best project(s).
- Make it clear what you want and what you can offer.
- Remove red flags, qualifications, caveats, and anything confusing.

#### Projects

> Reminder: if you have related work experience, put "Experience" before "Projects."

- Briefly explain each project, focusing on the skills and technologies you used to make it.
- Include your Bloc projects.
- List the most difficult projects first.

  > This generally means projects are in reverse-chronological order, assuming you worked on simpler projects earlier.

- Link to the GitHub repository for each project.

#### Experience

- List all work experience.
- For unrelated work, minimize detail.
- For related work…
	- Include websites you made for a friend.
	- Include any freelance work you've done.
	- List all technologies used.

- Be honest. Be succinct. Don't over-explain.

#### Skills

- Add all related skills you have.
- Sort the skills so those you want employers to focus on are at the top.
- Ask mentors and other Bloc students to endorse the skills you’re most proud of.

> Add unrelated skills if they're strengths of yours, but minimize them. Make sure nothing looks weird or irrelevant. For example, having 43 endorsements for “laser dentistry” when you’re looking for web developer roles could be confusing.

#### Education

- Include your Bloc education.
- If you have a degree, put it above your Bloc education.
- Don't use the word “bootcamp” in your description for Bloc. (This can distract employers.)

## Résumé

Your résumé is a brief (usually one-page) document that highlights your skills, education, and accomplishments. Its goal is to convince the reader that you're worthy of an interview. Most people who review résumés are tasked with picking a small number from a pile, so consider that your résumé might only get read for 5–10 seconds.

To that end, your résumé should be professional and more concise than your LinkedIn profile. You can write your résumé using a word processor. There are also sites like [Creddle](http://creddle.io/) and [Represent](https://represent.io/) that will render a document using a professionally-designed theme.

Because most people have seen and written résumés, we're assuming you know the basics, but we've provided a few important résumé guidelines below. As you read them, compare these two examples:

- [Bowen Yang](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3pzxInE0r63NHRDSE8zMlQ2RWM)
- [Adam Ellsworth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3pzxInE0r63c1Iyd0VCOGJQbEE/view)

### Length

If you have fewer than 10 years of experience, your résumé should be less than one page.

If you have more, your résumé should usually be less than two pages.

### Writing Style

Remove unnecessary words. Use the shortest version of a word that conveys your idea. For example, say "used" instead of "utilized," or "I want to code" instead of "I'm looking for a job where I can code."

Although brevity is important, don't sacrifice specificity. Generic phrases like can get your résumé discarded for being too vague. Be specific about the technologies involved.

| Too Vague                    | Specific Enough                                                                        |   |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Designed mobile UI           | ­ Designed responsive and engaging mobile UI using Angular, Ionic, and CSS animations­ |   |
| Added continuous integration | Introduced continuous integration and deployment using Docker, TravisCI and AWS­       |   |
| Added database               | Defined relational schemas using PostgreSQL to decrease layered query time             |   |
| Managed tasks                | Set product vision and assigned tasks to a team of 4 engineers using Git issues        |   |

A bullet point should be roughly ten words. Too short, and you might be too vague. Too long, and you might be too specific.

### Summary

Include a one-line summary at the top with important phrases bolded. Describe what you're good at and what you want to do.

### Education

In your education section, make sure Bloc follows any degrees you have.

### Experience

Focus on your next job, not less-relevant jobs.

If you referenced a job in your summary, include it in “experience".

For each job, focus on accomplishments instead of responsibilities. If you can quantify an accomplishment, do so.

Ask your mentor to review your skills they meet industry minimums.

## GitHub

Every Bloc student creates a GitHub account, so you're way ahead on this one. Technically-savvy recruiters use public GitHub profiles to determine the breadth and quality of a developer's work.

### Avatar

An eye-catching GitHub profile begins with an appropriate avatar. If you fail to provide one, GitHub generates one for you, like so:

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/multi-purpose-checkpoint-assets/job-prep-virtual-resume/bad-avatar.png)</center>

The default avatar gives the impression that its owner does not treat their profile seriously. If you don't have a professional headshot, use an appropriate head & shoulders photograph:

<center>[![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/multi-purpose-checkpoint-assets/job-prep-virtual-resume/good-avatar.png)](https://github.com/madebymunsters)</center>

### Public Contributions

Your histogram of public contributions can help showcase your work ethic. In this example profile, the histogram is sparse and may reflect poorly on its owner:

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/multi-purpose-checkpoint-assets/job-prep-virtual-resume/bad-histogram.png)</center>

A dense histogram is a flashy quantitative benchmark that does *not* reflect the quality of your work. However, it endows your profile with superiority over those who lack it:

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/multi-purpose-checkpoint-assets/job-prep-virtual-resume/good-histogram.png)</center>

Here are several ways to enhance the appearance of your histogram:

- Place all of your projects on GitHub.
- Make sure that every repository you own is *Public*.
- Contribute frequently to open-source projects as well as your own.

### README Files

Provide a high-quality README document with each of your projects. A README should include, at minimum:

- a synopsis of your project
- screenshots
- setup / installation instructions

The number of projects you have will certainly impress recruiters, but if readers discover empty READMEs within, they will replace their feelings of respect with feelings of uncertainty. Try to make your README polished and descriptive:

<center>![](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images-job-prep/swiftris-readme.gif)</center>

For README examples, refer to [Bloc's Swiftris Tutorial](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris-checkpoints) and [Bloc's Swiftris Source Code](https://github.com/Bloc/swiftris).

Remember, GitHub doesn't offer much in the way of curation, so there's no way to control which repositories potential employers might look at. Therefore, make all of your repositories look great.

## Assignment

- Create or update your LinkedIn profile using the guidelines in this checkpoint.
- Create or update your résumé.
