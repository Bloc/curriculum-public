Networking is a broad term that encompasses any time people interact to learn, to exchange information, or to develop contacts. Professionals in all fields network. Here are four examples:

- Joining conferences or Meetups
- Attending job fairs
- Having coffee or lunch with someone in your field
- Taking an ongoing education class

Networking is important to your career’s development. Through proper networking, you can hear about new job opportunities before anyone else. You can learn new high-demand skills, exchange advice, and even make a new friend. Most importantly, “[more than 70 percent of people land jobs through networking.](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2014/09/17/dont-believe-these-8-job-search-myths)”

As you develop your network, remember that you get out what you put in. If you decide to pass on a job opportunity, share it with someone else who’s looking. If you find a great article or video, send it to someone else who’s learning. Invite people you meet to events you’re attending. Engaging these people and investing in their success will pay dividends as they begin to engage and invest in yours.

## Connect with the Bloc Community

More than anyone else, Bloc students, graduates, mentors, and staff know where you’ve been and where you’re going. Bloc is already your network, so take advantage of it.

- [Find Bloc peers](https://www.linkedin.com/edu/school?id=162130) on LinkedIn
- Join and take part in [the `#careers-general` Slack channel](https://students-bloc.slack.com/messages/careers-general/)
- Collaborate on a project or share ideas in [The Bloc Hacker Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blocalumni/)

When you share your experience, other students will give advice and detail what has worked for them. Similarly, you should offer what has worked for you.

## Network and Build Relationships

Networking happens in one of two ways: offline and online. _Online_ networking occurs on e-mails, comment threads, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other online portals. Your primary goal when networking online is to bring those relationships _offline_.

Offline networking happens in person, in a meeting, at a conference, at Meetups, and anywhere you can communicate with people directly. Offline networking results in stronger relationships, and helps you seal the deal.

To cut straight to offline networking, look to these sources:

- Search for groups on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
- Find upcoming hackathons in your area on [Hackalist](https://www.hackalist.org/)
- Find Hackathons, conferences, and Meetups in your area through Google. For example, search for, “Ruby meetup New Orleans,” or, “JavaScript Hackathon Baltimore,” or “Developer conferences Houston.”
- If you’re a member of a minority group, look for groups that work toward broader inclusion.
  - Join every online portal your group(s) maintain, like Twitter lists, subreddits, mailing lists, Facebook groups, etc.
  - Introduce yourself and take part in their conversations.
- If you *cannot* find a local group, consider starting your own.

> We've had a number of students who have benefitted from Code for America Brigades. "Code for America Brigades are local volunteer groups that bring together community members to help make government work better." You can learn more at https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/

Online networking is comfortable because you are safe from judgment and have all the time in the world to come up with something to say. Conversely, if you’re not a naturally gifted speaker or feel anxiety when meeting new people, networking _offline_ will prove challenging.

For those struggling with social anxiety, we recommend reading Psychology Today’s, [“How to Overcome Your Social Anxiety,”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anxiety-files/201410/how-overcome-your-social-anxiety) and related materials. For naturally introverted people, this [Quora answer](http://qr.ae/RUgtKG) by a Bloc curriculum writer should help.

## Write and Practice Your Elevator Pitch

An *elevator pitch* is a short summary that relates your experience and career goals; it *sells* you. Write and practice this so you know what to say when someone asks you about yourself – a common occurrence in offline networking scenarios.

There are two rules for your elevator pitch:

1. It must be short
2. It must be interesting

The easiest way to make something both short and interesting is to hone in on a specific example. Use a project you worked on, your capstone, or an open-source contribution you made.

Here’s a *short* elevator pitch that’s *not* interesting enough:

> Hi, I’m Hannah McExample. I graduated from University of Chicago with a degree in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, but found it hard to get a job, so I took an online course at Bloc. Since then, I’ve interned for 4 months at United Airlines. I’m really good at Ruby on Rails. I’m on the job market for a full stack web developer job.

That’s all accurate information, but it doesn’t reel in the listener on Hannah’s abilities. People will have trouble remembering Hannah after hearing this, because the pitch sounds so generic.

Now consider this example, which *shows* knowledge and experience instead of explaining it:

> Hi, I’m Hannah McExample and as you know, airlines interpret lots of data so their flights run well. I interned at United where we combined FAA data, weather simulations, maintenance records, and historical overbooking data to keep planes full and on time. After we created a database, I wrote a Ruby on Rails dashboard to display the data and its conclusions to stakeholders.

This introduction will make listeners *think* about a flight they missed, or about what a “weather simulation” entails, or which overbooking data are available. It will make Hannah’s story stick in their mind, and they’ll remember Hannah as someone who is intelligent and interesting.

In the assignment for this checkpoint, you’ll write your own elevator pitch. Once it’s written, practice repeating it until you can summon the pitch at a moment’s notice.

## Overcome Impostor Syndrome

*Impostor syndrome* or *impostor phenomenon* is when you feel like a fraud despite your accomplishments. If you feel that you belong to the development community and you feel secure about your position, skip to the [assignment](#assignment). But, if you doubt yourself or are curious about the subject, read on.

Here’s an excerpt from [a 1978 report](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/h0086006) about women feeling like impostors in the workplace:

> “Despite outstanding academic and professional accomplishments, women who experience the impostor phenomenon persist in believing that they are really not bright and have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise. Numerous achievements, which one might expect to provide ample objective evidence of superior intellectual functioning, do not appear to affect the impostor belief.”

Learning to program lends itself to impostor syndrome. It’s impossible to become proficient in every aspect of programming; there’s too much to learn. What number of people know everything there is to know about Ruby? *Zero*. Not a CS grad, not your smartest developer friend, not even the creator of Ruby itself. No matter how experienced you are, you will always hear other developers discussing a new concept. You will feel like you don’t belong in the conversation, but you do.

Okay, you know what to call this rotten feeling, but now what? As with most struggles, your first step is to recognize the issue. Imposter syndrome is overwhelming and soul-crushing if you *believe* you’re the outsider. First, realize that it’s common. Then shift the problem from an internal judgment of yourself (*“I’m not a programmer”*) to an opportunity to expand your skill set (*“There’s a lot to learn, and I’m capable of learning it”*).

Impostor syndrome makes you doubt your capabilities. When applying to jobs, it can lead you to set your sights too low and accept a job or internship that is not worthy of your talents. To get over it: recognize it, discuss it, and remind yourself that no one enters the world with this knowledge. And merely months ago, you knew far less than you do now.
