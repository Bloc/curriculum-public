## Your First Application

As with any new skill, performing it the first time tends to be the most challenging. But after you complete the first one, each application thereafter consumes less time and triggers less stress.

For your first application, we suggest you aim for the stars. Choose a dream role or a dream company, and submit your application there. This is like applying for college, you have your dream schools and you should apply to them anyway – the results can surprise you.

<a name="reach-out"></a>
## Reach Out

Most organizations have a ready-made submission process that requires a résumé and little else. When you submit to them, the server plops your résumé onto a big virtual pile and from there, there’s no telling where it will end up. We recommend instead that you find a decision-maker at this company, and contact them directly.

<a name="request-an-introduction"></a>
### Request an Introduction

A warm introduction from a peer serves as the best introduction. If a peer introduces you, they add credibility to your application. If your peer likes you a lot, they will highlight your qualities to your prospective contact, thus giving you an even bigger boost.

LinkedIn shows you the connections you share with anyone on the site. These connections are perfect for making introduction requests. Ideally, the point person is someone you’ve worked with who can speak to the quality of your work and your character.

More importantly, they should hold sway over the person you wish to meet. Verify this beforehand by determining the nature of the relationship between your peer and your target contact. Let your peer know what your goal is and how they can make all the difference by introducing you. Most people will say yes, but if you’re evil and bent on world domination, they will probably say no.

If you can't find a valuable mutual contact, then introduce yourself through e-mail.

<a name="write-a-cover-letter"></a>
### Write a Cover Letter

One way to apply directly through a person is by sending a cold outreach e-mail. Let this e-mail serve as a cover letter. It must grab attention and convince people that among the massive pile of résumés, yours is worth reading. A great cover letter satisfies the following criteria: it’s unique, it showcases you, and it’s brief.

---

It’s tempting to change the recipient’s name on your cover letter, hit send, and then take a nap. But if you received a Christmas card from your lifelong best friend with nothing but, “Happy Holidays!” written on it, you would feel unappreciated. Recruiters want to feel special, too. They want to believe you wrote the cover letter specifically for them, which you did, because you _will_.

The cover letter must highlight one to three past experiences that make you an outstanding candidate for the position. This requires research to discover the company’s needs. With that information, you can tailor your cover letter to address their needs with your background. Doing so proves that you’re good for the job, that you’ve done your homework, and that you care.

Lastly, a great cover letter is brief. Everyone’s time is precious, and with hundreds of applications to consider, you don’t want to give the recruiter any reason to shuffle your application to the bottom. Use [the economy of words](http://www.maryrosemaguire.com/2013/09/24/want-master-economy-words/) and limit your letter to the two paragraphs featuring your most convincing attributes.

Read these fictional cover letters and pay special attention to how each applicant uses their traits and background to best serve the organization hiring them (or doesn’t).

## Where to Find Jobs

Before you can ask anyone for an introduction or send a single cover letter, you need to find the jobs first. The internet will inundate you with portals through which to look for work. We’ve done our research and narrowed them down to your best bets.

- [Angel.co](https://angel.co/jobs)
- [CareerBuilder](http://www.careerbuilder.com/)
- [Hired](https://hired.com/)
- [Indeed](http://www.indeed.com/)
- [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/job/home)
- [StackOverflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)
- [Y-Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs)
- [whitetruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/)

If your goal is to work remotely and avoid relocation, consider these services that specialize in helping you find remote work:

- [flexjobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/)
- [Remotive](http://jobs.remotive.io/)

## Track Your Progress

A spreadsheet is a great tool to keep track of your job hunt progress. [Copy this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12WvdOVOyebEY4fyMSrp1ypunE_W8quml9h6KENeVceQ/copy) into your Google Drive and share it with your mentor.

At each point of contact, whether it’s an introduction, e-mail, phone call, or interview, update the spreadsheet. Record communication dates and look to your spreadsheet every day; check whether to send a follow-up e-mail or phone call.

The goal is to keep you motivated and on top of your schedule. If you find the spreadsheet does not serve that purpose, consider another project management tool instead.

>Instead of using a spreadsheet directly, you can create a [Google Form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), and submit progress updates through it. Share the linked spreadsheet with your mentor.

<a name="track-e-mails"></a>
### Track E-mails

You can use a free service like [Sidekick](http://www.getsidekick.com/) or [Bananatag](https://www.bananatag.com/) to track the efficacy of your cover letters and cold outreach e-mails. Bananatag allows you to create templates, and you can send them in three clicks using Bananatag’s Chrome extension.

They also report metrics such as how often and when your recipients open your e-mails, and whether they click any links you include. This data can give you a better idea of when to follow-up, or whether to move on to another prospect.

<a name="adjust-your-pace"></a>
## Adjust Your Pace

The last, and most important thing for you to do is to adjust your pace. We **highly** recommend that you drop your current pace to one appointment per week, if possible. This extends the length of your program, and gives you more breathing room to focus on career efforts.

As soon as you lower your commitment to the material, increase your commitment to your search. Ask your mentor to help you fill in the blanks in the following statement:

<center><p style="text-align:justify">**“Beginning on {MM/DD}, I commit to apply to {X} companies per day and reach out to {Y} people per day.”**</p></center>

Once you commit to this, **stick with it**. Apply every day and reach out every day. We cannot stress this enough.

> We recommend applying fo jobs and slowing your Bloc program pace when you have 10% of your program remaining.
