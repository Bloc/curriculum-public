Job S. Eeker, a totally real human, is _right_; looking for a job is hard work. We believe that job hunting is its own skill, and if mastered, will serve you throughout your life. And as with web development, you will take small steps to build your job finding skills, beginning with how to narrow the search.

## Narrow Your Search

To focus your projects and networking efforts, narrow your list of potential companies. This allows you to focus on a subset of decision makers. You can start to narrow your focus by choosing a location.

<a name="by-location"></a>
### By Location

Most software companies and the jobs they offer belong to major metropolitan areas, and you will improve your chances by moving to one. We recommend getting acquainted with professionals in your desired areas as soon as possible. Here is a list of metropolitan areas that we recommend for engineering roles:

* Metro Atlanta
* Greater Austin
* Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan Area
* Greater Boston
* Chicago Metropolitan Area
* Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex
* Delaware Valley
* Boulder/Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Colorado
* Indianapolis Metropolitan Area
* Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan
* Greater Houston
* Las Vegas Valley
* Miami Metropolitan Area
* Minneapolis-Saint Paul
* New York Metropolitan Area
* Metro Phoenix
* Greater Portland
* San Diego County
* San Francisco Bay Area
* Seattle Metropolitan Area
* Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (Canada)
* Metro Vancouver (Canada)

### By Vertical

We recommend choosing a market vertical to focus your networking and projects on. Tech is not an industry, yet people often mistake it for one. Health care, construction, and transportation are examples of industry verticals, and each leverages technology to solve problems. You should choose an industry that you are familiar with and have passion for.

There is no official list of "industry verticals", but here is a list of some examples to help you understand the concept:

* B2B SAAS
* E-Commerce
* Education Tech (like Bloc!)
* Finance Tech
* Health Tech
* Marketplaces

### By Role

Choosing a specific role helps you tailor your LinkedIn profile and resume to the requirements of that position. An application that looks perfect for a small set of positions is more appealing than an application that looks average for every position. Here is a subset of roles that graduates of Bloc can consider:

| Role                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Experience Required                                     |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| Software Engineer               | This position is the core of every software product team. The company’s most senior software engineers are the authorities on the product and non-technical employees will seek their guidance before requesting big product changes. Larger organizations provide levels of software engineer positions, beginning at level one. | 1+ Years Working in Software                            |
| Junior Developer                | Most developers begin in this position. People in this role work on the product: fixing bugs, implementing features, writing tests, and more. Companies often pair junior developers with more experienced, senior developers as mentors.                                                                                         | CS or Bootcamp Graduation                               |
| Development Operations (DevOps) | Individuals responsible for DevOps manage servers, automate maintenance tasks, provision new services, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1+ Years Maintaining and Setting up Servers             |
| Automation Engineer             | Larger organizations often maintain a separate team whose primary concern is to test the company’s software products. Automation engineers write and maintain the test suite which includes both unit and functional tests.                                                                                                       | Programming Knowledge and Testing Experience            |
| Quality Assurance (QA)          | QA personnel use the product, find and file bugs, and poke and prod at each build. While not a technical role in nature, it’s a great place to start for those with technical skills who wish to graduate to software development.                                                                                                | Passion for Technology, Knowledge of Software Workflows |

### By Size

Software is eating the world, so every industry can and will incorporate technology to streamline their businesses. It’s safe to assume that regardless of where you want to work, they have technical positions to fill. Consider the following company archetypes. Each requires a different approach and some are more accessible to bootcamp students than others:

| Type                 | Examples                                          | Strategy                                                                                                                      |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small, Non-Technical | Blogs, Storefronts, and Local Government.         | Network directly with the decision makers. If you can, meet them in person.                                                   |
| Large, Non-Technical | Restaurant Chains, Publishers, and Manufacturers. | Look for open positions and apply. If you know people working there, seek their recommendation.                               |
| Small, Technical     | Startups, Contracting Firms, and Web Designers.   | Create profiles on StackOverflow, Angel.co, and others. Seek help from technical recruiters and build LinkedIn relationships. |
| Large, Technical     | Google, Amazon, and IBM.                          | Create connections on LinkedIn and meet with employees. Apply for positions online.                                           |
